# Blazor Rules (Optimized)

- Use AntDesign Blazor 1.4.0 for Razor components.
- Private variables: prefix with '_'.
- Only one table per Razor file (split if needed for clarity).
- Always show loading indicators and result notifications for user actions.
- Inject service classes directly in Razor Components (no API calls from Razor Components).
- Use Cookie authentication for Admin security.
