# Backend Rules (Optimized)

- For new modules: create entity in `Models/Entities`, add DbSet/config in `Data/ShoeStoreDbContext.cs`, create DTO (if needed), add mapping in `Models/Mapping`.
- Use `Services/ProductService.cs` as a template for new services.
- Register all services in ServiceContainer.cs (DI).
- Each service method: use a new dbContext instance from IDbContextFactory.
- Optimize queries for large/critical tables.
- After service: build API controller (no admin-only APIs such as Create/Update/Delete Product).
- Use JWT for API security.
