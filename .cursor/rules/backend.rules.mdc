# Backend Rules (Optimized)

- For new modules: create entity in Models/Entities, add DbSet/config in Data, create DTO (if needed), add mapping in Models/Mapping.
- Use ProductService.cs as a template for new services.
- Register all services in Program.cs (DI).
- Each service method: use a new dbContext instance from IDbContextFactory.
- Optimize queries for large/critical tables.
- After service: build API controller (no admin-only APIs).
- Use JWT for API security.
